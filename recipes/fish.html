    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <p>This mildly-spiced fish curry with a coconut milk base is one of the most popular South Indian curries. 
        The recipe is easy to make, whether it's a hectic weekday 
        dinner or a lazy Sunday afternoon lunch. A well-made Fish Moilee will always be 
        an absolute delight for the family and the cook as well! You can also replace the fish, 
        with prawns to make another simple variation of the preparation.
